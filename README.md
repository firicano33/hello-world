Module 2 Assignment 1 - Salvatore Firicano
My name is Sal Firicano and I am a student at Boston University and my current classs is MET CS633 OL1 Spring 2021.  At this moment, this exercise is helping me to understand the GIT process.  Overall I hope to apply what I have learned in this class to my current role as Sr. Director of IT at Eloxx Pharmaceuticals.
